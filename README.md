Design a local, multi-agent AI backend using Python, LangGraph, MCP, and Ollama LLM to simulate agent-to-agent negotiation for credit offers between a consumer and three different banks. Agents communicate using the Wells Fargo Agent Protocol (WFAP) via JSON/YAML messages and expose chatbot UIs (preferably React-based) for separate user roles, but for now only give backend code: consumers and banks. Agents must: Accept prompt-based interfaces for users (consumer and bank side). Consumer agent: receives loan intent, extracts details (amount, duration, purpose), dispatches to bank agents using WFAP (JSON/YAML). Bank agents: verify identity, receive and review requests, evaluate (mock) risk/ESG/carbon impact, respond with offers. Consumer agent: aggregates received offers, runs decision logic (lowest carbon-adjusted rate, best terms, ESG), selects winner, explains decision. All agents must expose MCP-backed tool interfaces for traceability/logging, agent-to-agent protocol compliance, and verification steps. All logic and protocol flows are handled via LLM-powered agents using Ollama. Gimme repo structure also
